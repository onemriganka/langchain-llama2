Introduction
Text summarization is the process of distilling the main ideas and important information from a piece of text, allowing users to quickly grasp its key points. This project combines the capabilities of Langchain, a language modeling tool, and LLAMA2, a summarization framework, to build a text summarization model that can handle a variety of input texts and generate concise and coherent summaries.

Installation
To get started with using the text summarization model, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository 
  

Follow these steps to use the text summarization model:

Input Data: Prepare the text data you want to summarize. This could be a single document, a paragraph, or a series of sentences.

Run the Model: Use the provided scripts to run the text summarization model. The specifics will depend on the implementation details of Langchain and LLAMA2. Generally, you will need to load the pre-trained models, process the input text, and generate a summary.

Output: The model will generate a summarized version of the input text. This summary should capture the essential information and key points from the original text.

Contributing
